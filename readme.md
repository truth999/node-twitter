# Node Twitter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vinitcool76/node-twitter.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vinitcool76/node-twitter)

## About 
This project is an attempt to build a twitter clone in node.

## Inspiration
Inspired by @madhums work on nodejs and his nodejs-express-mongoose-demo

## Installation instruction

You must have node, npm and mongodb installed for the application to work.
In order to install Node and NPM : http://nodejs.org
In order to install mongoDB: http://mongodb.org

```bash    
$ npm install
```
## How to run

In order to run the project, do:

```bash
$ mongod
$ npm start
```
### Important

This application uses facebook and github for authentication so you should create your own facebook and github apps with `http://localhost:3000` as the application url for testing on local machine. These credentials from the facebook and github app are to be stored in `config.js`.
